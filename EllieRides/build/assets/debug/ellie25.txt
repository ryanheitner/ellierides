Ignoring Ellie, Dad went to fetch Ellie's bike and set to work. ^ Ellie decided to watch him. ^ 
Dad lowered the seat on Ellie's bike to the lowest it could go. ^ He took off the training wheels. ^ Then he did something strange, he took off the pedals. ^ 

"Why are you taking off the pedals ?" Ellie asked. ^  

"You will find out," said Dad. ^ | ~
