Dad took three steps backwards down the hill. ^ He asked Ellie to lift her feet slightly off the ground and let the bike roll forward slightly. ^ Ellie held the handlebars tight and lifted her feet just a little bit off the ground. ^ The slope was already enough to let her roll forward. ^ Before she knew it she was already at Dad. ^ She did not even have time to wobble. ^ ~
