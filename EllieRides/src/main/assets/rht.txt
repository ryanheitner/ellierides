Ellie Rides. ^ |It was Thursday and Ellie had just come home from a very messy day at school. ^
She had a splotch of green paint on her left cheek, a blob of yellow paint in her long curly red-brown hair, and clay all over her shirt and jeans. ^
It had been a fun day and she was full of smiles. ^ ~

Ellie decided to run around the house really, really fast pretending that she was a fire engine. ^
Just as she started to gather speed the doorbell rang – drrrrrinng. ^ Ellie slammed on her fire engine brakes and squealed with delight and clapped her hands in excitement. ^ |Whenever the doorbell rang Ellie liked to hide. ^ She was an expert at hiding and she could make herself teeny tiny so that nobody could ever find her. ^

The best fun was to hide under the big table and wait to see if it was Granny and Gramps. ^ If it was them, she would keep very, very quiet, as quiet as a mouse that had laryngitis and who was wearing slippers. ^ ~

When Granny and Gramps were facing the other way she would run up behind them and shout BOOOOOO in her loudest voice. ^ They would always get a big fright and jump, and she would always laugh so much that her tummy hurt. ^ 

Ellie waited under the table. ^ She waited and waited but nobody came. ^ She grew tired of waiting and decided to investigate who was at the door. ^ |"Who is at the door Mom?" Ellie shouted as she ran towards the door and peered through her Mom's legs. ^  

It was a boy, with a shiny blue bicycle. ^ The bike was big and did not have little training wheels on it. ^ That meant it had to be a big boy! ^ ~ 

The boy however, looked about the same size as Ellie. ^ Ellie was five and a half years old which was quite big. ^ It was much bigger than four and also bigger than five without the half. ^ The boy had big green eyes and a kind face, he wore a shiny green bicycle helmet. ^ 

Ellie knew that as long as she stayed between her mother's legs and held onto one leg the boy could not see her, she would be invisible. ^ 
Ellie wanted to stay invisible, but even more than that she wanted to know who this boy was and what he was doing at her house. ^ |"Ellie" her Mom said, "This is Sammy and he has just moved in next door. He is five years old, the same age as you." ^  

"I am not five" Ellie said , forgetting completely that she was supposed to be invisible, "I am five and a half". ^  

Sammy wants to know whether you want to go outside and play with him" ,said Ellie's Mom. ^ ~

"I can ride without training wheels" Sammy announced, "I can ride really fast and I don’t fall down a lot." ^  

"I can ride faster than you!" said Ellie. ^  

Ellie was not sure that she could ride faster, but she knew what she was supposed to say when someone said they were fast. ^ 
Ellie had training wheels on her bike to stop her falling over. ^ Dad had tried to take them off once, okay twice, but Ellie would not let him. ^ 
She liked the training wheels and she was scared to ride without them. ^ |"Ellie, do you want to go get your bike and go outside to play with Sammy?", her Mom asked. ^  

Ellie did want to get her bike and go outside, but she was not sure. ^ She did not want Sammy to see that she still had training wheels attached to her bike. ^ ~ 

Maybe Sammy would laugh at her. ^ She did not like it when people laughed at her. ^ Ellie did not want Sammy to think that she was a little girl. ^ 
She was a big girl. ^ She was even bigger than Sammy since Sammy was five and she was five and a half. ^  

She also did not want to have a race because she was not really fast, the training wheels made her go slowly. ^ She also wanted to stay close to her Mom. ^ |Ellie decided to keep quiet. ^  

Her Mom said to her, "Ellie go and get your bike." ^  

Keeping quiet was not going to work, so Ellie quickly came up with another plan. ^ "I don't want to. ^ I am too tired and I have got a very sore head and sore legs." ^ ~

Sammy's face looked a bit sad. ^ 

"Maybe some other time, Sammy," said Mom. ^ "Thank you for coming to visit". ^ With that, Mom closed the door and gave Ellie her “slightly disappointed” look. ^ |"Ellie, it was very nice of Sammy to ask you to come and play with him. ^ How do you think he felt when you said no?" ^  

"How would you feel if you asked a boy or girl to play with you and they said no?" Mom persisted. ^  

"…sad," said Ellie in her tiny voice. ^ ~

"Mom I want to learn to ride my bike without training wheels" said  Ellie. ^ 

Mom's face changed quickly from her “slightly disappointed look” to her “that's a good idea look” and a twinkle appeared in her eye. ^ |Dad came home from work at 5 o'clock as usual. ^ He gave Ellie and Mom a hug and a kiss. ^  
He had a chat with Mom, and then he left the house and went next door. ^  
Ellie knew that something was happening, but she did not know what. ^ |Dad came back after what seemed like ages. ^ It was 5:25. ^  

He was carrying a green helmet, a spanner and some black things, which Ellie did not recognize. ^ |Ellie, can you stand on one leg and count to 10, without falling down?" asked Dad." ^ 
 
"Easy peazy" said Ellie and straight away she did it "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10" ^ ~  

"Excellent" said Dad. "Can you stand on the other leg and count from 10 down to 1". ^  
 
"Even easier" said Ellie who was very good at balancing and at counting. ^  

Straight away she did it "10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1". ^ |"Bravo Ellie" said Dad. "Can you stand on no legs, flap your arms really fast, fly to the ceiling and count to 500 ?"  Dad asked with a huge smile on his face. ^  

"Close your eyes and block your ears." Ellie said with a laugh. ^ |"Ellie, you are ready!!!" exclaimed Dad. ^  

"Ready for what?" asked Ellie. ^  

Dad replied, "You are ready to ride to without training wheels, like a big girl“. ^  

I spoke to Sammy's Dad and he explained to me an easy and fun way to learn to ride a bike. ^ ~

Sammy's Dad said that if you could stand on 1 leg and count to 10 you could do it." ^ 

"I don't want to, I can't!" said Ellie. ^ Ellie really did want to, but she was a bit worried. ^  

"OK, you don't have to." said Dad. ^  ~ 

Ignoring Ellie, Dad went to fetch Ellie's bike and set to work. ^ Ellie decided to watch him. ^ 
Dad lowered the seat on Ellie's bike to the lowest it could go. ^ He took off the training wheels. ^ Then he did something strange, he took off the pedals. ^  

"Why are you taking off the pedals ?" Ellie asked. ^  

"You will find out," said Dad. ^ |"Here let me help you put these on." Dad took some black things, and started strapping them on Ellie's knees and elbows. ^  

"What are these ?" Ellie asked. ^  

"They are knee guards and elbow guards to protect you in case you fall." ^ ~ 

Dad then tapped the knee guard Ellie was wearing, with the spanner and he asked "Does that hurt?" ^  

"Not at all,” said Ellie", “I do not want to ride the bike," she insisted. ^  

"That's fine, you do not have to" said Dad, but he just carried on preparing. ^ He put the helmet onto Ellie's head. ^ |"We are ready" declared Dad. ^ "Quick! Let's go, before it gets dark, before Mom sees us. ^ Mom will be so surprised and happy when she sees you can ride a bike like a big girl, I’ll be proud too." ^ 

"We can show Granny and Gramps," said Ellie, "and Sammy too." ^ Ellie had forgotten all about not wanting to ride and her sore head. ^ ~ 

Dad took Ellie to the top of the path in the park at the end of their road. ^ The path was on a gentle slope. ^  

Sometimes Ellie would come there with Mom and bring her blue ball. ^ She would go to the top of the path and roll the ball down the hill. ^ 
She would race the ball to the bottom. ^ Ellie always won. ^ |Dad asked Ellie to get onto the bike and to put her feet flat on the ground. ^  

Dad held the bike while Ellie got on. ^  

Ellie put her feet flat on the ground. ^ There were no pedals to get in the way. ^  

Dad let go of the bike and… ^ Ellie stayed right where she was. ^ At first she was a little scared but soon it became boring just sitting there, she wanted to move. ^ |Dad took three steps backwards down the hill. ^ He asked Ellie to lift her feet slightly off the ground and let the bike roll forward slightly. ^ Ellie held the handlebars tight and lifted her feet just a little bit off the ground. ^ The slope was already enough to let her roll forward. ^ Before she knew it she was already at Dad. ^ She did not even have time to wobble. ^  

"Dad - I want to do it again, but this time I want you to go far-er" said Ellie ^  

"Further" said Dad not "far-er." ^ |This time Dad took seven steps backwards. ^  

Ellie started to roll forwards. There was a small wobble halfway but she only touched the ground slightly with her left shoe. ^  

The worried look on Ellie's face had been replaced by a smile. ^ ~ 

"Again, Again, further !" pleaded Ellie. ^  

"Uhhhhh, no I think it is time to go home." said Dad in his teasing voice. ^ "We do not want to do too much when you have a sore head." ^  

"My head is better now" said Ellie "pleasssssse" She begged. ^ |This time Dad went 20 steps back and said, "Try and see if you can get to me without touching the ground". ^  

Off Ellie went. ^ The bike wobbled a bit, but she turned the handle bars this way and that and managed to go all the way to Dad without touching the ground… not even once. ^ |Dad picked her off the bike, threw her high into the air, caught her, twirled around really fast, hugged and kissed her and told her she was a champion. ^  

Ellie's squeals of laughter, scared some of the doves in the tree nearby and they flew away to a find quieter tree. ^ |Ellie and Dad carried on playing the rolling down the hill game a few times, each time rolling slightly further until soon Ellie could ride from top of the hill to the bottom. ^  

Dad said, "Ok now it is time to put the pedals back." ^ ~

Once the pedals were back on Ellie did the rolling game again, but this time she rested her feet on the pedals. ^  

The second time she did it with pedals on, Ellie decided to try and surprise Dad when she got to the bottom of the hill. ^ 
This time she did not put her feet down on the ground to stop, this time she started pedalling. ^ ~ 

She rode along the flat part at the bottom of the hill pedalling. ^ 
She was really riding a bike, properly like a big girl, like Sammy! ^ It was easy peazy. ^ 
Dad was running next to the bike shouting, "Hooray!!!" and clapping his hands. ^ Ellie felt like a superstar. ^ |Next Ellie tried turning. ^ Slight turns at first, but soon she could go round and round in a big circle. ^  

Then Ellie tried falling. ^ Well… she did not really try falling, it was more like falling tried her. ^  

She was not watching where she was going. ^ She was watching Dad next to her when suddenly a tree jumped right in front of her. ^ 
Dad said not to worry the tree was fine, and that she only had a small scratch on her hand and some mud on her clothes. ^ Ellie did not cry, not even a bit. ^ |"Ellie !… Ellie !… - Dinner !" a loud voice could be heard calling. ^ It was Mom. ^  

"Ellie - lets show Mom what you can do." said Dad. ^ |Ellie was up like a shot. ^ She had forgotten all about the small scratch on her hand. ^ "Mom! Mom! Mom! Come and watch me, I can ride without training wheels." shouted Ellie. ^  

Mom went to stand at the bottom of the hill, while Dad took Ellie to the top. ^ One, two three! Off she went, when she got to the bottom, she pedalled once around and stopped right next to Mom. ^ 

Now it was Mom's turn to give Ellie hugs and kisses and tell her what a champion she was. ^ |Champions needed to eat dinner and needed to have a good night’s sleep. ^  

The next day after school, when Ellie arrived home she noticed that Sammy was already in the park at the end of their road riding his bike. ^ ~ 

"Mom, can I go ride my bike in the park with Sammy ?" asked Ellie. ^ 

"As soon as you have had lunch and done your homework you can go," answered Mom. ^  

Never before had lunch been eaten as fast, or homework been done as quickly. ^ Ellie was soon ready with her bike, her helmet and knee and elbow guards, looking like a big girl and like a champion. ^ |
