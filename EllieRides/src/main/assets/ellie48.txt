"Mom, can I go ride my bike in the park with Sammy ?" asked Ellie. ^ 

"As soon as you have had lunch and done your homework you can go," answered Mom. ^  

Never before had lunch been eaten as fast, or homework been done as quickly. ^ Ellie was soon ready with her bike, her helmet and knee and elbow guards, looking like a big girl and like a champion. ^ | ~
