Whenever the doorbell rang Ellie liked to hide. ^ She was an expert at hiding and she could make herself teeny tiny so that nobody could ever find her. ^

The best fun was to hide under the big table and wait to see if it was Granny and Gramps. ^ If it was them, she would keep very, very quiet, as quiet as a mouse that had laryngitis and who was wearing slippers. ^  ~
