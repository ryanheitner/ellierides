When Granny and Gramps were facing the other way she would run up behind them and shout BOOOOOO in her loudest voice. ^ They would always get a big fright and jump, and she would always laugh so much that her tummy hurt. ^

Ellie waited under the table. ^ She waited and waited but nobody came. ^ She grew tired of waiting and decided to investigate who was at the door. ^ | ~
